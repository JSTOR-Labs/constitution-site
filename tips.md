## Tips

* Forget where the Commerce Clause is?  You can jump to any clause in the Constitution using the little text box on the home page.
* Some sections of the Constitution (such as the First Amendment) contain multiple clauses.
To limit the articles you see to those about the clause you’re researching, first enter that clause in the text box on the home page
* If the clause you’re looking at has too many articles from JSTOR to get through, tap the icon.  There, you can fine-tune your results to 
show what matters to you first.  Choose from thousands of topics and then calibrate each to get the perfectly-sorted set of results.
