### Known Issues

* Jumping to a clause brings you to the top of the Article and Section the clause appears within, not directly to the clause itself if it appears deep within a Section.
* In citations copied and pasted from the app, fields that should be italicized are tagged with an "< i >" but are not fully formatted. 
* It is possible to select a clause (such as the signatures in Article 7) with 0 articles quoting or referring to it, leading to a zero-results page.
* Occasionally the icon to refine your search results appears at the bottom of the screen (when this happens, restart the app to correct the display.)
